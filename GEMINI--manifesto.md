# Winamp Clone - Manifesto

## The Spirit
In a world of bloated streaming services, complex libraries, and algorithmic "discoveries," we return to the core of music listening: **The File.**

This is not a library manager. This is not a social network for music. This is a **player**. 

## The Problem
Modern music players treat your files like commodities that need to be "imported," "indexed," and "synced." They often copy files into hidden folders (the "iTunes ritual") or lock you into their ecosystem.

## The Solution
A simple, high-performance, and visually stunning web-based MP3 player that respects the user's files.
- **Direct Access**: Use files from their original location (as provided by the user).
- **Temporary Queue**: A playlist that exists for the session. No database, no overhead.
- **Pure Aesthetics**: A nod to the classic Winamp but with a 2026 premium aesthetic. Glassmorphism, smooth animations, and high-fidelity visualizers.

## Future Plans
- Support for more formats (FLAC, WAV, OGG).
- Advanced spectral visualizers.
- Skinning support (modern interpretation).
- Local storage persistence for the current playlist (optional/toggleable).
