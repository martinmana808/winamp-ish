# Winamp Clone - Manifesto

## The Spirit
In a world of bloated streaming services, complex libraries, and algorithmic "discoveries," we return to the core of music listening: **The File.**

This is not a library manager. This is not a social network for music. This is a **player**. 

## The Pivot to Native
While web technologies are powerful, a true macOS experience requires **Native Swift**. We have transitioned from Electron to a pure Swift/SwiftUI implementation to leverage:
- **AVFoundation**: For industry-standard audio processing.
- **System Performance**: Lower CPU/Memory footprint than a browser-based shell.
- **Deep Integration**: Native Drag & Drop and window behaviors.

## The Solution
A simple, high-performance, and visually stunning native macOS MP3 player.
- **Direct Access**: Use files from their original location.
- **Temporary Queue**: A playlist that exists for the session.
- **Retro Aesthetic**: A faithful recreation of the classic Winamp skin, modernized for 2026.

## Future Plans
- Metal-accelerated visualizers.
- System-wide media key support.
- Custom skin loading via Swift package resources.
